Text-Based Browser

About
Sometimes you need to read online documentation or find something on the Internet from the command line or terminal. So, let's use Python to create a text-based browser! Of course, making a real, full-blown browser is a very difficult task. In this project, you'll create a very simple browser that will ignore JavaScript and CSS, won't have cookies, and will only process a limited set of tags. Still, it will be useful and, most importantly, fun to program!

Learning outcomes:
You will learn how HTTP works and how to handle its protocols using Python. You will also learn all about Python input/output, as well as parsing HTML.
What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
1)
Let's create the first capability for our browser! It has to read the URL and show the user a "hard-coded" website with some news.

2)
Time to add some user-friendliness. The program should store our pages as files and show them if the user enters a shortened request. Watch for inappropriate input, though!

3)
Sometimes you want to revisit the past. Let's add a “back” button by using the stack.

4)
Time to play in a new way. Now only real web pages! Get to know the Request library.

5)
Let’s enhance the readability of our pages and teach our browser to output only a certain text from HTML tags.

6)
Look-and-feel is important to the browser experience. Let's read about a new library, experiment a bit, and highlight our links in blue.
